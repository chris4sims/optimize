# optimize
This is an R source package, so it can be downloaded and installed as a local R package.  The `csminwelNew` program uses a gradient-based method to maximize a function.  It can use numerical or analytic derivatives, and can take advantage of R's ability to return both a function value and its gradient using `deriv`. 
# Why use this?  
It is well tested on a variety of economic models.  It attempts, not necessarily successfully, to avoid getting stuck at discontinuities.
